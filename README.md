Hello,

My name is Kerr Fitzgerald

I am currently a PhD student researching and developing artificial intelligence systems for medical image analysis. I have extensive knowledge on the mathematics and theory underpinning many data science/machine learning algorithms and excellent Python programming skills. 

I am passionate about using data science and machine learning to develop and implement systems to improve people’s lives. I love learning new skills/programming languages and I am enthusiastic about encouraging more people to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).

Prior to starting my PhD, I spent 6 years working as a computational physicist in the UK nuclear industry. I worked as part of a multidisciplinary team to successfully deliver different customer projects and government funded research projects.

I have experience with: <br />
           -  Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebooks, Anaconda) <br />
           -  PyTorch (Convolutional Neural Networks, Vision Transformers, Image Classification, Image Segmentation) <br />
           -  FORTRAN (Nuclear Fuel Performance Modelling) <br />
           -  C++ <br />

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Kaggle projects, machine learning projects and image analysis projects.
