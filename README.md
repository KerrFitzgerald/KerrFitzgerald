Hello,

My name is Kerr Fitzgerald

I am currently a PhD student researching and developing artificial intelligence systems for medical image analysis. I have extensive knowledge on the mathematics and theory underpinning many data science and deep learning algorithms.

Prior to starting my PhD, I graduated from Durham University with a Physics Degree (2013) and spent 6 years working as a computational physicist in the UK nuclear industry. I worked as part of a multidisciplinary team to successfully deliver many different customer projects and government funded research projects focussing on reactor physics and nuclear fuel performance modelling.

I am passionate about using Python, data science and machine learning to implement systems for data/image analysis with real world applications. I love learning new skills and programming languages.

I have experience with: <br />
           -  Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebooks, Anaconda) <br />
           -  PyTorch (Convolutional Neural Networks, Vision Transformers, Image Classification, Image Segmentation) <br />
           -  QuantConnect (Algorithmic Trading)
           -  FORTRAN (Nuclear Fuel Performance Modelling) <br />
           -  C++ <br />

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on: computer vision projects and data analysis projects.
