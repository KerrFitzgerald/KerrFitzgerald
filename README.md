- 👋 Hi, I’m @KerrFitzgerald

- 👀 I’m interested in deep learning systems for medical image analysis.

- 🌱 I’m currently researching/learning about machine learning, image analysis, transformer networks.

- 🌱 I have experience with: <br />
           - 🌱 Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebooks, Anaconda) <br />
           - 🌱 PyTorch<br />
           - 🌱 C++ <br />
           - 🌱 FORTRAN <br />

- 🌱 Projects I have worked on: <br />
           - 🌱 Image analysis using deep learning <br />
           - 🌱 Atomistic modelling <br />
           - 🌱 Nuclear fuel performance modelling <br />

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Kaggle projects, machine learning ptojects and image analysis projects.
